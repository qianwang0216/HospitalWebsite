        <h2>Diagnostic Imaging Services</h2>
    <p>Our modern department utilizes a Radiology information system (RIS) computed radiology system (CR) along with a Picture Archiving Communication System (PACS) to capture and store images in a digital format. The combined systems permit the images to be read by remote Radiologists, viewed by Specialists and other health care professionals in the North Network System to continue the circle of care for our clients. Our department offers a 24/7 on-call service for emergencies. A francophone technologist is on staff.</p>

<h3>X-Ray</h3>

<p>X-rays are a form of radiant energy, like light or radio waves.  Unlike light, x-rays can penetrate the body, which allows a Technologist to produce pictures of internal structures.  The Technologist can view these on photographic film or on a TV or computer monitor.</p>

<p>X-ray examinations provide valuable information about your health and play an important role in helping your doctor make an accurate diagnosis. In some cases x-rays are used to assist with placement of tubes or other devices in the body or with other therapeutic procedures.</p>

<p>General Xray Procedures - no appointment necessary</p>

<p>Gastrointestinal Series (GI Series) - by appointment only</p>

<p>Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP) - by appointment only</p>

<h3>Ultrasound</h3>

<p>Diagnostic Medical Ultrasound, commonly called sonography, is a diagnostic medical procedure that uses high frequency sound waves (ultrasound) to produce dynamic visual images of organs, tissues, or blood flow inside the body.</p>

<p>All Ultrasound procedures are by appointment only.</p>

<p>The Technologist can view these images on a specialized computer monitor. X-RAY FILM IS NO LONGER USED.</p>
